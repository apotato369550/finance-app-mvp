# Planner Logs

This directory contains implementation plans created by the Planner agent.

## Purpose

Planner logs document:
- Feature requirements and architecture
- Step-by-step implementation plans
- Acceptance criteria
- Test strategies
- Technical decisions and rationale

## File Naming Convention

`dd-mm-yyyy_[feature-name].md`

Example: `03-11-2025_user-dashboard.md`

## When Logs Are Created

A new planner log is created when:
- A new feature is being designed
- A complex enhancement requires architectural planning
- Multiple components need coordinated changes
- Technical decisions need documentation

## Log Structure

Each planner log should include:
1. Overview and goals
2. Current state analysis
3. Architecture design
4. Implementation steps with acceptance criteria
5. Testing strategy
6. Notes for other agents

## Usage

These logs serve as blueprints for Builder to execute. They provide complete context and detailed instructions to ensure consistent, high-quality implementation.
